# Guess That Word
<!-- use ezgif -->
**‘Guess that Word’** is a terminal game that tests the English vocabulary of its users by letting them guess words as they are defined. It gives them 3 game modes to choose from: (1) Easy, (2) hard, and (3) Beat the Highscore. The ‘Easy’ mode and ‘Hard’ mode each provide 15 words to guess and the number of correct guesses will be shown to the user at the end. For the ‘Beat the Highscore’ mode, the user will also be provided with 15 words (8 are easy, and 7 are hard) but with a scoring; and at the end of the game the total score will be shown and a highscore will be saved that the user can beat in the future. In all these modes of the game, 3 hints are provided: (1) the number of letters, (2) 1st and last letters - after first failed try, and (3) more letters within the word - after 2nd failed try.
